## Data Model:

This project uses Djangoâ€™s Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) to handle data interactions between the application and PostgreSQL. The key models are as follows:

- **User**: Handles authentication and user profile information.
- **Post**: Represents a news article or story, including its title, content, author, category, and timestamp.
- **Comment**: Represents user comments on a post.
- **Category**: Represents a grouping or category of posts (e.g., Politics, Technology).
- **Vote**: Handles upvoting and downvoting of posts and comments.

The relational model ensures each post has associated comments, votes, and categories.



## Testing:

Manual testing was conducted by simulating common user behaviors, including:
- Creating posts and comments as a logged-in user.
- Upvoting and downvoting posts.
- Filtering posts by category.
- Ensuring valid inputs and error handling for invalid inputs (e.g., invalid post data, duplicate votes).

Automated unit tests were also written for core functionalities such as post creation, comment submission, and user authentication.

## Bugs:

### Solved Bugs:
- Pagination initially displayed incorrectly on smaller devices. This was fixed by adjusting the CSS for responsive behavior.
- An issue with user authentication when attempting to comment was resolved by properly linking the user session to the comment submission form.

### Remaining Bugs:
- Currently, no known bugs remain.

## Validator Testing:

All Python code has been validated using `flake8`, and the HTML has been tested using [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/). No major issues were found.
